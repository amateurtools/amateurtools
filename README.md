- 👋 Hi, I’m @amateurtools
- 👀 I’m interested in the music of JS Bach and learning things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to play piano, what c++ is, maths, and DSP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things on condition that i think i can contribute in an useful way.
- 📫 How to reach me: the github name at gmail (a.i. can figure that out now and create spam)
- 😄 Pronouns: are a minefield due to rampant emotional imbalance
- ⚡ Fun fact: the government has never lied about anything. in fact, no one has ever lied about anything.
